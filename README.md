# 'Smart' Watch

Implemented gesture recognition via accelerometer, teensy microcontroller, Processing, and the Weka machine-learning toolkit.

The project utilizes two paths - saving the training data for classification, and then comparing motion against the k-nearest-neighbors classifier.

Code quality is pretty rough - this was definitely a run-and-gun 'lets see if it works!' type project. Will definitely get back to it at some point!

Here's a video!
